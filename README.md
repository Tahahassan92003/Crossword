Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) 

It looks like you're implementing a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver for a crossword puzzle, using techniques like enforcing node consistency, arc consistency (AC-3), and backtracking search. The `Variable` class represents crossword words with attributes such as starting position, direction (ACROSS or DOWN), and length, while the `Crossword` class initializes the grid structure from a file, determines valid words from a vocabulary file, and identifies overlapping constraints between words. The `CrosswordCreator` class manages solving the puzzle using CSP techniques. First, it initializes domains for each variable based on word length. The `enforce_node_consistency` function ensures that only words matching the required length remain in each variable's domain. The `revise` function makes a variable arc-consistent by removing words that cannot satisfy constraints with a neighboring variable. The `ac3` function iterates through all arcs, ensuring consistency by applying `revise` and adding constraints dynamically. The solver follows a backtracking approach to find a valid assignment once consistency checks are enforced. Additionally, helper functions allow visualization of the crossword, including printing and saving it as an image using the PIL library. However, your `assignment_complete` function appears to be incomplete. Let me know if you need help finalizing it!
